# Welcome, to ByteBots official GitHub!
Hello, and welcome to the official GitHub account of ByteBots Development, web and Discord bot development founded by chris. We mainly focus on developing our Discord bots, Vegasbot and Scrobbly and websites associated with them. If you wanna get to know us more, read this file!

## Who are we?
We are a group of beginning and non-beginning developers that had decided to work together and make awesome projects. The name "ByteBots" was created in the whole beginnings of ByteBots, in the early beginning of 2022, from the words "byte" and "bots". Byte I don't even know and remember what was supposed to mean and bots for the thing we mainly focus on, Discord bots. As of today, we are working on two of our main projects; MikuBoat and MindBot. You can read more about MindBot on fye's GitHub.
